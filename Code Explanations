# Importing necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, LabelEncoder
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

This section imports the necessary libraries:
numpy and pandas for numerical and data manipulation.
train_test_split from scikit-learn to split the dataset into training and testing sets.
StandardScaler and LabelEncoder from scikit-learn for feature scaling and label encoding.
load_iris from scikit-learn to load the Iris dataset.
Sequential and Dense from Keras for building the ANN model.




# Load Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

This section loads the Iris dataset using the load_iris() function from scikit-learn and assigns the features to X and the target variable to y.




# Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

This line splits the dataset into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data used for training (X_train and y_train) and 20% for testing (X_test and y_test). The random_state parameter ensures reproducibility.




# Standardizing the features
sc = StandardScaler()
X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = sc.transform(X_test)

This section standardizes the features by scaling them to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 using StandardScaler.




# Encoding categorical data
encoder = LabelEncoder()
y_train = encoder.fit_transform(y_train)
y_test = encoder.transform(y_test)

This part encodes the categorical target variable into numerical values using LabelEncoder.




# Building the ANN model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(units=8, activation='relu', input_dim=4))
model.add(Dense(units=6, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(units=3, activation='softmax'))

This section defines the architecture of the ANN model using the Sequential API of Keras:
It consists of three layers of densely connected neurons (Dense layers).
The first layer has 8 neurons, ReLU activation function, and input dimension of 4 (number of features).
The second layer has 6 neurons with ReLU activation.
The output layer has 3 neurons with softmax activation, suitable for multi-class classification.




# Compiling the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

This line compiles the model, specifying the optimizer (adam), loss function (sparse_categorical_crossentropy), and metrics to evaluate (accuracy).




# Training the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size=5, epochs=100)

This line trains the model using the training data (X_train and y_train) with a batch size of 5 and 100 epochs.




# Evaluating the model
accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print('Accuracy:', accuracy)

This line evaluates the trained model on the test data and prints the accuracy.




# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print(predictions)

This part generates predictions using the trained model on the test data and prints them.
